# Go-ing Gopher Hunting with Elasticsearch and Go

This repository provides an introductory example of using the Elasticsearch Go client to find documents in Elasticsearch. Specifically, it covers three types of search:

1. Traditional keyword search.
2. Vector search, making use of the [sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L-12-v3 model from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L-12-v3) to generate the embeddings.
3. Hybrid search combining the keyword and vector approaches.

If you are looking to start using Elasticsearch with Go I recommend checking out the [client documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/go-api/current/index.html) and [this series](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/perform-text-queries-with-the-elasticsearch-go-client) covering search fundamentals with the Go client.

## How to Run

### Elasticsearch Instance Setup

The quickest way to set up your own cluster is to register for a [free trial of Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup). You'll need to perform these additional steps:

1. Note your Cloud ID
2. [Generate an API Key](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/api-keys.html)
3. Populate your instance with data in the same format as those in the [Sources](https://github.com/carlyrichmond/gopher-hunting-elasticsearch#sources) section below
4. [Upload your model from Hugging Face using Eland](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/eland/current/machine-learning.html#ml-nlp-pytorch)
5. Enriching your ingested documents using an [ingest pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html)

### Pre-requisites

This script requires setting the essential environment variables before running the script. I recommend using something like `direnv`, invoked via `.envrc` and then adding the variables to a top-level `.env` file. Alternatively, you can explicitly set the environment variables in your current session according to your operating system.

The following environment variables are required:

- `ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID=<MY_INSTANCE_CLOUD_ID>` 
- `ELASTIC_API_KEY=<MY_API_KEY>`

### Starting the server

Running `server.go` will start a `net/http` server on port `8080` that you can use to query Elasticsearch:

```bash
cd server
go run .
```

Navigate to the below URLs to obtain the Gopher search results for each search type:

* Keyword: [http://localhost:8080/gophers](http://localhost:8080/gophers)
* Vector: [http://localhost:8080/vector-gophers](http://localhost:8080/vector-gophers)
* Vector with keyword filter: [http://localhost:8080/filtered-gophers](http://localhost:8080/filtered-gophers)
* Vector with query embeddings generated using the [Hugging Face inference API](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings): [http://localhost:8080/embedding-vector-gophers](http://localhost:8080/embedding-vector-gophers)
* Hybrid search with manual boosting: [http://localhost:8080/hybrid-gophers](http://localhost:8080/hybrid-gophers)
* Hybrid search with RRF: [http://localhost:8080/rrf-gophers](http://localhost:8080/rrf-gophers)
